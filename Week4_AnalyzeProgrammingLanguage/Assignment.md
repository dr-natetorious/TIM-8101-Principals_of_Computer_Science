# Part A: Understanding C++ (5 points)

For the first part of the assignment, answer the following questions based on this weekâ€™s reading (1 page for all three answers):

1. What are machine and assembly languages? What are their major features and components, and what problems do they typically address?
2. Where is C++ used in the real world, and where it is not used? Briefly describe how it compares to other popular languages.
3. What is the purpose of a compiler, and how does it compile a C++ program? Include a diagram to describe your work.


# Part B: C++ in Research (5 points)

For the second part of the assignment, you will examine some current research being done on C++, or where C++ formed the basis of the research. Using the NCU Library, find a recent work (less than two years old) from a peer-reviewed source that has conducted work on C++. Briefly (3 pages) describe:

1. How did C++ fit into the research?
2. What were the research questions?
3. What did the authors find?
4. What is some future work which could be built upon this research? Include both what the authors found, and describe things in your own words.
5. What are some similar/contrasting works and their findings?

Length: At least 5 pages, not including title and reference pages

Your submission should contain references to at least 5 peer-reviewed sources. All writings must be formatted properly, and must have a logical flow and transition between them.
