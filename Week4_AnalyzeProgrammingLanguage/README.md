# Week 4 Analyzing Programming Languages

The core focus of this week has been on programming languages and how they are used.

A deep dive into the compiler technologies was also performed.

## What did you learn?

### C/C++ as a build target

It was interesting to see how C/C++ is a build target in many ways. 

Niche languages can use the LLVM compiler to generate into C/C++ source code.

Afterwards standardized tools exist to inject optimiziers and mutators into the Abstract Syntax Tree.

There are parallels to this model and the new efforts in Microsoft's Rosyln compiler.

### Language Design

The [Programming Language Pragmatics](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncent-ebooks/detail.action?docID=649018#) was very complete. 

With each of the concepts it gave credit to the originating languages and described how others continued the effort.


## What were the assignments for the week?
