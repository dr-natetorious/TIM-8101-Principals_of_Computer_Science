# What is a Makefile?

When building code on unix a common pattern is to encode build commands as `Makefile` files.

This makes reproducing the results easier as everything is automated.

## How Do I 'make' Makefiles? 

This tutorial was useful crash course. There are a lot of macros which makes sense as it needs to scale to big projects.

You see similar effects with `.props` and `.targets` in msbuild based environments. Luckily this appears to be a lot of copy/paste.

## Where is the make file from this experiment?

The file can be found at [CppReferesher/Makefile](CppRefresher/Makefile).

This is a partial implementation due to switching to Visual Studio on the second day.
