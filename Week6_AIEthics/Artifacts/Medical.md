## Emerging AI Wellness Landscape: Benefits and Potential Areas of Ethical Concern

The [California Western Law Review](AI_Wellness_Landscape.pdf) discusses areas of wellness that are tangible, intangible, and embedded.

Definitions:

    - Wellness is the holistic health a person; mental, physical, spritual, sexual, etc.
    - Tangible wellness are devices such as smart watches
    - Intangible wellness are virtual assistance, video monitoring, background compute etc.
    - Embedded wellness is the fusing of human to computer; eg wired brains

They discuss the duality of AI technology being both helpful and harmful in the same scenarios. Consider a shut-in that can be comforted by a sex robot. This is positive as they are less lonely, yet more detached from the outside world.

## Ethical Issues of AI in Medicine

The [California Western Law Review](EthicalIssues_AI_Medicine.pdf) explores practical applications of AI such as deep learning on image diagnostics.

### What is the content outline

    - Reliability of prediction
        - Requires big data
        - Challenges with overfitting
        - Missing data points cause incorrect guesses

    - Lack of transparency and evidence
        - Hidden layers of DNN are black box

    - Liability, Security, and Privacy
        - If AI system kills the patient who is liable?
        - Cybersecurity

    - Morality in the future
        - AI surgeries are 2x as long
        - Cost 20% more and high maintence costs
        - Need to justify that expense
        - AI surgery tasks have a 3.7% failure rate, should they not be used until 0%

### Any additional notes

AI is required for medicine as there is too much data for the doctor to keep track of. It is compounded by the sensors and demographics which make certain interactions or or less relevant.

They expect that full surgeries will be automonous versus presently only certain tasks are. The tasks which are automated significantly outperform humans with a mortality rate of 1% vs 8.9%.

The on page 271 the journal makes an argument that until AI reaches 0% failure rate. This is irrational as the humans have a higher failure rate and are continuing to be used.
