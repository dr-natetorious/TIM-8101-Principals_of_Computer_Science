## Doing good vs. Avoiding bad in prosocial choice

The [Journal of Experimental Social Psychology](DoingGood_vs_AvoidingBad.pdf) explores why actors choose to be ethical. They frame the conversation in terms of prosociality.

They propose hypothesis:

    - Desire to reach equality everywhere
    - Giving with desire of reciprocity; eg. tip the bartender for better drinks
    - Gaining utility by doing right; eg. makes you feel positive
    - It is easier to be moral and avoid the consequences

These are framed as positions within the 2x2 matrix:

    - TOG frame: Give – Do Good
    - TOG frame: Give – Avoid Bad
    - TOG frame: Equalize – Do Good
    - TOG frame: Equalize – Avoid Bad
