# International Opinion

These artifacts focus on the international communities view toward ethical systems and AI.

## European Perspective on Responsible Computing

The [Communications of the ACM](EuropeanPerspective_ResponsibleComputing.pdf) wrote about the European Commission's [new guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai) on responsible AI systems.

"Europe is at the forefront of the regulation and reflections on these issues though its institutional bodies (p84)."

### What are the recommended guidelines

_Human agency and oversight_: AI systems should enable equitable societies by supporting human agency and fundamental rights, and not decrease, limit or misguide human autonomy.

_Robustness and safety_: Trustworthy AI requires algorithms to be secure, reliable and robust enough to deal with errors or inconsistencies during all life cycle phases of AI systems.

_Privacy and data governance_: Citizens should have full control over their own data, while data concerning them will not be used to harm or discriminate against them.

_Transparency_: The traceability of AI systems should be ensured.

_Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness_: AI systems should consider the whole range of human abilities, skills and requirements, and ensure accessibility.

_Societal and environmental well-being_: AI systems should be used to enhance positive social change and enhance sustainability and ecological responsibility.

_Accountability_: Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for AI systems and their outcomes.

### What is GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation is an effort to give individuals control over their personal data and to provide a unifying regulation within the EU for international business.

The first effort was aimed at privacy and offering features such as "right to be forgotten." This is the second phase which is aimed focused on autonomous systems -- anything that can derive context without humans.

## Many Worlds, Many Theories, Many Rules

The [Revista Brasileira de Politica Internacional](ManyWorlds_EthicalSystems_for_the_world.pdf) explores the requirements of ethical systems within the International community.

If one is to build a system that models ethical behavior then it is critical to understand different implementations of the model.

Onufn talks about the need to understand the scope and context that the ethics are being presented. Without stopping to gain this information it is difficult to fully understand why things are important to a society.

### The multi-world theory

Professor Onufn states there are four worlds:

- our personal world
- the rest of the world
- the world as the largest possible whole
- the staitened world; post apocolypse socialist movement to come

"Society [... is ...] the background condition for all the things or objects that members of society talk about (p1)." The fabric holds together many worlds and combines them into even larger worlds.

Each of these worlds will have a different set of goals, resources, and priorities that will shape their collective perceptions. No world is completely anything, but lives on a continuom that is so much liberal, conservative, traditional, modern, etc.

### Duty versus Duty Holder

Many societies create rules which are specific to their group, often with conflicting positions. This creates different roles such as a duty and duty holder. Example it is illegal to murder another person but permissable for a police officer to shoot a suspect.

That logic would suggest that for any given `behavior` a permission set is applied to it. Unethical behavior is merely an unauthorized actor performing that role. If the actor is authorized to perform the action then it is ethical.

### Modern characteristics of ethical design

Modern thought is that societies are have (p12-4):

_Stasis_: a preference toward keeping the status quo

_Machismo_: a sense that traditional societies give too much emphasis to honor or respect

_Paternalism_: a coupling of authoritarianism and leadership styles

_Infantilization_: an acceptance to treat natives as children and expect they will act like children
