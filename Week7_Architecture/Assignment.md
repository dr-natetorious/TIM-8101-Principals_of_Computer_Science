While cloud computing offers numerous possible benefits, it does pose many challenges. One of these challenges is in the security. Your task for the week is to imagine that you work for an e-health organization, and you are considering moving your information to the cloud. You should make a recommendation for the organization moving the e-health data for to the cloud. Your recommendation should come in the form of two components: A) a brief report and B) a presentation based on your findings. Prepare your recommendations for the senior leadership team of your organization.

Your presentation should provide the audience with the following:

- Explain how cloud computing has been used to help in e-health solutions.
- Determine what some challenges in this area are.
- Illustrate what types of data are typically stored in the cloud for e-health.

- Provide your recommendation for the organization and explain why. You should also discuss why you are making this recommended direction. (Provide ample evidence to back up your stance.)
- Identify and explain any challenges your organization may encounter when proceeding with your recommendations.
- Provide research-oriented resources to help with your recommendations.
