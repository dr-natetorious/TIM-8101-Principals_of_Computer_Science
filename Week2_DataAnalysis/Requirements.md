# Week 2 Assignment

The collection of data has changed not only the way which we live and work, but also how we communicate. Social media generates tremendous amounts of data which are used from everything from advertising to urban planning.

Your assignment for the week is to perform a brief analysis on the Facebook data provided by Leskovec. Your analysis should include the following:

1. Explain how the data were created.
2. Determine weaknesses/areas of improvement in the data.
3. Identity what research is based off this data.
4. Predict what future research could be based off of this data.
5. Summarize how the data are structured/stored.

Your submission should also include a brief sample research area in which the information could be used. In short, you should actually perform a study using this data. However, for this sample exercise, it may be kept brief (1-2 pages of the final assignment submission).

Support your assignment with at least five scholarly resources. In addition to these specified resources, other appropriate scholarly resources, including older articles, may be included.

Total Length: 8-10 pages, not including title and reference pages

Your assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
