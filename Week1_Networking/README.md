Very nice work on your poster. It was visually appealing while covering the required content for the assignment. While reading your paper, I noticed that you placed citations after almost every sentence in your writing. While citations are necessary, please keep a good balance between using them and providing the reader with your own original thoughts and ideas. Also, remember to proofread. I ran across a few typos and grammatical errors.
